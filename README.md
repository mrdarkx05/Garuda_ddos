## Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attack 🌐

DDoS attacks are like overwhelming virtual traffic jams! It happens when multiple systems work together to bombard a target website or server with an enormous amount of traffic. This avalanche of requests overwhelms the target's resources, causing it to slow down or become unavailable for legitimate users.

🎯 **Purpose:** DDoS attacks can disrupt services, cause financial losses, and tarnish an organization's reputation. Understanding DDoS is crucial for cybersecurity professionals to strengthen defenses and ensure online services remain accessible.

🛡️ **Defensive Strategies:** To defend against DDoS attacks, organizations employ specialized network infrastructure, firewalls, and traffic filtering systems. Regular security assessments using tools like Garuda DDoS Tool help identify weaknesses and fine-tune protection mechanisms.

✨ **Ethical Use:** Knowledge of DDoS is valuable for ethical hackers to design robust systems and counteract potential threats. Always remember to use this knowledge responsibly and never for harmful purposes.
